# Codex Playground 🎮✨🚀

Welcome to my little Codex-powered playground! 🎉
This repo is where I mess around, explore ideas, and build fun things with Codex. 🧪🛠️

## What's This? 🤔💡
- A personal sandbox for experimenting with Codex
- A place to build random, useful, and sometimes silly stuff
- A growing collection of mini projects, cheatsheets, and creative experiments

## Current Vibes 🌈🎨
- Hands-on learning by building
- Trying new UI styles and layouts
- Keeping things playful, practical, and fast to iterate

## Why It Exists 🧭💬
Because making things is fun, and Codex makes it even more fun. 🧡
This repo is my space to try ideas without pressure and keep shipping tiny wins. 🏃‍♀️💨

## Status 📌
Always evolving. Always tinkering. 🧩🔁
